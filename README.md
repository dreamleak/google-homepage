# Google Homepage Project 
## deconstruct an existing web page and rebuild it.

The Odin Project assignment is based around rebuilding a pre-existing webpage, and the one for this project is the google homepage. Building a basic form, positioning, and aligning items were the main objective.

I experienced minimal frustration when using flexbox and positioning elements to move my divs around. Inline css came in handy for the specific placements for the navigational bar and footer's contents; although, I am sure there's a cleaner way to write said code. I sparingly used Firefox's Developer Tools as reference, in addition to testing my knowledge. Developer Tools is such a convenient way to inspect the original source, and it never ceases to amaze me. 

Steadily becoming more comfortable with not striving for accuracy as much. The perfectionist within me is learning a lot about patience, most importantly.
